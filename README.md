## Practice - DevOps
This is a practice project, meaning that it doesn't contain any relevant content or useful software.  
The main goal of it is to try out things that help the development process of a project.  

### Install & Build scripts
These scripts install everything needed to build the project, then they build it.  
They were made for barebone virtual machines that only have **Git** installed.  
If you already have **VS Studio 2015+** on your OS, then you don't need these.  
- **Win7**: [install_Win7.cmd](https://github.com/Zentrom/Practice-DevOps/blob/dev2/docs/install_Win7.md)
- **Win10/Win11**: [install_Win10.cmd](https://github.com/Zentrom/Practice-DevOps/blob/dev2/docs/install_Win10.md)
